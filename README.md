## Shower Scrubber code

This is a fairly simple thing, an automated shower scrubber design.

It will be designed to specifications such as these:

| Metric                                  | Type     | Value (With units) |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------- | :----------------- |
| Machine Footprint                       | **MAX**  | 18" x 18"          |
| Battery Life                            | **MIN**  | 2 hours            |
| Turn radius                             | **MAX**  | 1"                 |
| Brush speed                             | **TOL**  | 500 rpm ± 100 rpm  |
| Water pressure at nozzle                | **TOL**  | 30 psi ± 10 psi    |
| Slip detection                          | **BOOL** | True               |
| Water resistant                         | **BOOL** | True               |
| Robot speed                             | **MAX**  | 6 feet/minute      |
| Cleans rectangular and circular showers | **BOOL** | True               |
| Brush change time                       | **MAX**  | 5 minutes          |
| Judge evaulation of cleanliness         | **BOOL** | True               |
| Machine weight (dry)                    | **MAX**  | 15 lbs.            |
| Water capacity                          | **MAX**  | 3 liters           |
| Soap capacity                           | **MAX**  | 1 liter            |

We are as of yet unsure what language to use because of course this is yet to be built and a microcontroller hasn't been chosen.
